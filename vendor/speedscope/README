This is an integration of https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope into stackprof.

This is done by including the built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sources of speedscope directory into the source tree.

# Updating

First, ensure you have `npm` installed: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm. Don't worry! End users of
stackprof will not need to have node or npm installed at all. These steps are only necessary if you
want to update the copy of speedscope included in the sources of stackprof.

Afterwards, run the ./update.sh script in this directory.

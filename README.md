## stackprof

a sampling call-stack profiler for ruby 2.1+

inspired heavily by [gperftools](https://code.google.com/p/gperftools/),
and written as a replacement for [perftools.rb](https://github.com/tmm1/perftools.rb)

### getting started

#### Install

In your Gemfile add:

```ruby
gem 'stackprof'
```

Then run `$ bundle install`. Alternatively you can run `$ gem install stackprof`.


#### Run

in ruby:

``` ruby
StackProf.run(mode: :cpu, out: 'tmp/stackprof-cpu-myapp.dump') do
  ...
end
```

via rack:

``` ruby
use StackProf::Middleware, enabled: true,
                           mode: :cpu,
                           interval: 1000,
                           save_every: 5
```

reporting:

```

```

### sampling

four sampling modes are supported:

  - :wall (using `ITIMER_REAL` and `SIGALRM`)
  - :cpu (using `ITIMER_PROF` and `SIGPROF`) [default mode]
  - :object (using `RUBY_INTERNAL_EVENT_NEWOBJ`)
  - :custom (user-defined via `StackProf.sample`)

samplers have a tuneable interval which can be used to reduce overhead or increase granularity:

  - wall time: sample every _interval_ microseconds of wallclock time (default: 1000)
  - cpu time: sample every _interval_ microseconds of cpu activity (default: 1000 = 1 millisecond)
  - object allocation: sample every _interval_ allocations (default: 1)

samples are taken using a combination of three new C-APIs in ruby 2.1:

  - signal handlers enqueue a sampling job using `rb_postponed_job_register_one`.
    this ensures callstack samples can be taken safely, in case the VM is garbage collecting
    or in some other inconsistent state during the interruption.

  - stack frames are collected via `rb_profile_frames`, which provides low-overhead C-API access
    to the VM's call stack. no object allocations occur in this path, allowing stackprof to collect
    callstacks in allocation mode.

  - in allocation mode, samples are taken via `rb_tracepoint_new(RUBY_INTERNAL_EVENT_NEWOBJ)`,
    which provides a notification every time the VM allocates a new object.

### aggregation

each sample consists of N stack frames, where a frame looks something like `MyClass#method` or `block in MySingleton.method`.
for each of these frames in the sample, the profiler collects a few pieces of metadata:

  - samples: number of samples where this was the topmost frame
  - total_samples: samples where this frame was in the stack
  - lines: samples per line number in this frame
  - edges: samples per callee frame (methods invoked by this frame)

the aggregation algorithm is roughly equivalent to the following pseudo code:

``` ruby
trap('PROF') do
  top, *rest = caller

  top.samples += 1
  top.lines[top.lineno] += 1
  top.total_samples += 1

  prev = top
  rest.each do |frame|
    frame.edges[prev] += 1
    frame.total_samples += 1
    prev = frame
  end
end
```

this technique builds up an incremental callgraph from the samples. on any given frame,
the sum of the outbound edge weights is equal to total samples collected on that frame
(`frame.total_samples == frame.edges.values.sum`).

### reporting

multiple reporting modes are supported:
  - text
  - dotgraph
  - source annotation

        34  (18.1%)          34  (18.1%)     block in A#math

                         |    11  |   def pow
   91  (48.4% / 100.0%)  |    12  |     2 ** 100
                         |    13  |   end
A.newobj (/Users/tmm1/code/stackprof/sample.rb:15)
                         |    15  |   def self.newobj
   33  (17.6% /  56.9%)  |    16  |     Object.new
   25  (13.3% /  43.1%)  |    17  |     Object.new
                         |    18  |   end
A#math (/Users/tmm1/code/stackprof/sample.rb:20)
                         |    20  |   def math
    1   (0.5% / 100.0%)  |    21  |     2.times do
                         |    22  |       2 + 3 * 4 ^ 5 / 6
block in A#math (/Users/tmm1/code/stackprof/sample.rb:21)
                         |    21  |     2.times do
   34  (18.1% / 100.0%)  |    22  |       2 + 3 * 4 ^ 5 / 6
                         |    23  |     end
```

### usage

the profiler is compiled as a C-extension and exposes a simple api: `StackProf.run(mode: [:cpu|:wall|:object])`.
the `run` method takes a block of code and returns a profile as a simple hash.

``` ruby
# sample after every 1ms of cpu activity
profile = StackProf.run(mode: :cpu, interval: 1000) do
  MyCode.execute
end
```

this profile data structure is part of the public API, and is intended to be saved
(as json/marshal for example) for later processing. the reports above can be generated
by passing this structure into `StackProf::Report.new`.

the format itself is very simple. it contains a header and a list of frames. each frame has a unique id and
identifying information such as its name, file and line. the frame also contains sampling data, including per-line
samples, and a list of relationships to other frames represented as weighted edges.

``` ruby
{:version=>1.0,
 :mode=>:cpu,
 :inteval=>1000,
 :samples=>188,
 :missed_samples=>0,
 :frames=>
  {70346498324780=>
    {:name=>"A#pow",
     :file=>"/Users/tmm1/code/stackprof/sample.rb",
     :line=>11,
     :total_samples=>91,
     :samples=>91,
     :lines=>{12=>91}},
   70346498324900=>
    {:name=>"A#initialize",
     :file=>"/Users/tmm1/code/stackprof/sample.rb",
     :line=>5,
     :total_samples=>185,
     :samples=>1,
     :edges=>{70346498324780=>91, 70346498324680=>58, 70346498324580=>35},
     :lines=>{8=>1}},
```

above, `A#pow` was involved in 91 samples, and in all cases it was at the top of the stack on line 12.

`A#initialize` was in 185 samples, but it was at the top of the stack in only 1 sample. the rest of the samples are
divided up between its callee edges. all 91 calls to `A#pow` came from `A#initialize`, as seen by the edge numbered
`70346498324780`.

### advanced usage

the profiler can be started and stopped manually. results are accumulated until retrieval, across
multiple start/stop invocations.

``` ruby
StackProf.running?
StackProf.start
StackProf.stop
StackProf.results
```

### todo

* file/iseq blacklist
* restore signal handlers on stop
